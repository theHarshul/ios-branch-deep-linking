  * Verified Xcode 8.3 and iOS 10.3 compatibility.

- v0.14.5
  * *Beta Release*
  * Added two new Branch methods for handling opening scheme-based URLs from an app delegate.
    These methods match the corresponding UIApplicationDelegate methods and allow the Branch SDK
    more flexibility when handling scheme-based URLs.  The methods are:

```
        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
                    openURL:(NSURL *)url
          sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication
                 annotation:(id)annotation;
```
    and
```
        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
                    openURL:(NSURL *)url
                    options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options;
```

  * Added light-weight logging. AIS-193 (#591)

- v0.14.1
  * *Beta Release*
  * Added a new Branch class, `BranchShareLink`, that encapsulates a `BranchUniversalObject`,
    `BranchLinkProperties`, and sharing interaction for easier and more flexible Branch link
    sharing. The class can provide `UIActivityItemProvider` items or present an Apple Activity View
    Controller.
  * Added an example of sharing with the `BranchShareLink` in the Testbed-Swift example app.
  * Added a new BranchUniversalObject method `[BranchUniversalObject userCompletedAction:withState:]`.
  * Minor bug fixes and unit test updates.
  * Updated `transaction_id` for commerce events.
  * Fixed a crash bug when adding Branch identity to Fabric answers.

- v0.13.5
  * Updated Xcode 7 example project to work on iOS 7.
  * Added iAd framework to Swift example so that the Apple Search Ad query works.

- v0.13.1
  * *Beta Release*
  * Version strings are now displayed in the testbed apps.
  * Made sure that Branch callbacks happen on the main thread.
  * Fixed the Xcode 7 example to work with unit tests.
  * Fixed content discovery to work consistently.
  * Updated the Apple Search Ad debug mode campaign name to 'DebugAppleSearchAdsCampaignName'.

- v0.13.0
  * *Beta Release*
  * All the unit tests now compile, run, and pass.
  * Added the `branchAPIURL` property to `BNCPreferenceHelper` instances.
      This property can be set when testing with mocking frameworks like WireMock, where canned
      server responses are needed for functional testing scenarios.

      This property can be set before Branch is initialized.  For example:
      ```objc
      [BNCPreferenceHelper preferenceHelper].branchAPIURL = @"http://localhost/branch-mock";
      [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
      ```

      Be sure to use the Branch production API URL in production apps!

    TestBed-Swift project.

- v0.9.3
  * Clearing the Link Cache on logout; links shouldn't be shared between users.

- v0.9.2
  * Fixing check for isReferrable. No longer automatically setting to true for `handleDeepLink:`, and checking against `@0` since `nil` isn't possible.
  * Making PreferenceHelper and non-singleton, and saving to file instead of using NSUserDefaults which made us prone to having our info wiped out from under us. Also keeping objects in memory, so that they don't need to be retrieved for each reference.

- v0.7.6
  * Exposing `isUserIdentified` to allow devs to understand if Branch has a User Identity set.
  * Removing all instances of `bnc_no_value` from the SDK.
  * Creating a separate error code for Branch being down vs a request failing
  * Fixing a bug where and error would cause queue processing to stop, and pending request to be failed.

- v0.7.5 Prefixing constants to avoid collisions with other frameworks.

- v0.7.4
  * Fixing key usage throughout the SDK. When you call `getTestInstance` or `getInstance:`, the proper key will now make it through to requests.
  * Cleaning up debug logic internally. The static usage of `setDebug` is now deprecated, please move toward using the instance method.

- v0.7.3
  * Fixing Branch down check (>= 500 instead of > 500).
  * Removing tag from all BNCServerInterface methods.
  * Moving request retry delay off the main thread.
  * Removing committed CocoaPod files.

- v0.7.2
  * Added docs to the header, compatible with [AppleDoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc) and available on [cocoadocs.org](cocoadocs.org).
  * De-coupling all of the Branch dependencies to make them injectable. This will significantly improve test stability.
  * Clearing all Branch related items when the Branch key being used in the app changes. This prevents invalid items from making it to the server.

- v0.7.1 Adding a missing item to the pod spec headers.

- v0.7.0
  * Large rewrite of the internals of Branch.m to make things more stable, predictable, readable, and maintainable.
  * Added callbacks to the `redeemRewards` methods.
  * Updating Queue persistence to be non-immediate. Rather than persisting to disk on every change, it persists after time has elapsed to prevent hanging issues when in a loop.
  * Making errors more specific -- now you actually get the error message back, instead of a generic one.
  * Fixing issue with BranchActivityItemProvider when using the Twitter share sheet.
  * Removing temporary backwards compat typedefs.

- v0.6.3:
  * Addressing an issue identified by iHeartRadio where decoding a JSON string could cause crashes.

- v0.6.0: We have deprecated the use of `bnc_app_key` and are now using `branch_key`, which can be obtained in the settings page of your Dashboard. The replacement in the SDK should happen in the plist, as well as in `+(Branch *)getInstance:(NSString *)branchKey;` if necessary.

- v0.5.9: Revert of the URI Scheme updates.

- v0.5.8:
  * Fixing an issue with the creation of NSError userInfo dictionaries.
  * Updating behavior of URI Scheme detection -- you should now name the scheme you want to use "io.branch.sdk." The previous behavior will be maintained for some time.
  * You can additionally specify which scheme to use via `[[Branch getInstance] setUriScheme:@"myapp://"]`

- v0.5.7: Adding handling around the Facebook share sheet to prevent incorrect link clicks. Removing `branch_key` warning message.

- v0.5.6: Issue sending proper update to server if isReferrable not set

- v0.5.5: Reverting branch_key change until server component is updated. Fixing an issue with getShortUrl failures causing crashes.

- v0.5.4: A large number of changes have been included in this version, but all are backwards compatibile.
  * Retry Number has been added to all requests, so that the server is able to differentiate.
  * Organization of some of the encoding methods in the repository has been centralized.
  * Fixed an encoding bug with empty param dictionaries and arrays.
  * A couple of encoding issues were fixed, and a large number of tests have been added.
  * Perhaps most importantly, the `branch_key` is now replacing the `bnc_app_key` and `app_id` items. For now, both will continue to work, but the non-`branch_key` items are deprecated, and will be removed with `0.6.0`.
  * The presence of `app_id` and `branch_key` has been ensured across all requests, no longer piecemeal.

- v0.5.3: Follow up to 0.5.2, now looks at Documents directory creation date and considers this to be the original app install date

- v0.5.2: Recent iOS update resets bundle file creation date on update, messing with our update/install detection method

- v0.5.1: Fixed request black hole after initSession failed
